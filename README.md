âœ¨ Project Completed! âœ¨
I'm excited to share that I have successfully completed my Chatbot project as part of the tasks assigned by Code Alpha! ðŸŽ‰

This project allowed me to explore Natural Language Processing (NLP) by implementing user interaction, pattern-based responses, and real-time conversation handling. Creating a chatbot that can understand and respond to basic queries was a great learning experience!

Looking forward to taking on more exciting projects like this! ðŸš€
